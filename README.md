# event-manager
This project was a Ruby tutorial with added functionality. 
The tutorial piece demonstrated:
- manipulating file input and output
- reading content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
- transforming it into a standardized format
- utilizing the data to contact a remote service
- populating a template with user data
- manipulating strings
- accessing Googleâ€™s Civic Information API through the Google API Client Gem
- using ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating

The additional functionality I added:
- import phone number data from file, correct errors, validate it, and produce useful output
- import string dates, convert to DateTime object, use strptime and strftime methods to pull hours and days in order to create a distribution of each in the user data
